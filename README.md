agafua
======

A fork of the agafua project for sending Syslog messages by a java application.

This was a prototype for an util.logger and log4j appender using the syslog protocol. 
It forkes http://code.google.com/p/agafua-syslog/.
It was planned to extend it by RFC5424.

Then I recognized that JBoss 7.2 also supports Syslog which made this project unnecessary.
